As per data given by Food and Agriculture Organization ,1/3rd of food produced for human consumption is wasted globally, which accounts for almost 1.3 billion tons per year. On the other hand, also as per WHO 20% of the population face extreme food shortages. Hence there is a need to come up with a solution that can avoid food waste & can help feed the needy.
The web application-based Food Waste Management system can assist in collecting the leftover food from hotels & restaurants to distribute among those in need. NGOs that are helping poor communities to battle against starvation & malnutrition can raise a request for food supply from restaurants through this application. Once the request is accepted, the NGOs can collect the food from the restaurants for its distribution.</a></li>

Image to speech conversion abstract is The traditional way of reading a book is through a printed copy. It’s not possible to carry a physical copy of a book everywhere, that’s when ebooks came in handy. Printed books as well as e-books affect the eyes. Visual impairment is one of the biggest limitations for humanity, especially in this day and age when information is received by reading a lot of books (electronic and paper based). A study performed on “Listening or Reading: what’s more effective?” shows us that people tend to understand more while listening to a book rather than reading it.
Reading books and e-books have effects on your health. Most of the problems are caused in eye i.e. eye straining. Elderly people have a problem with their eyesight. Reading books

Speech to text conversion abstract is There are people out in the world who have some disability that might either be by birth or
accidentally at any point in their life. Few of them are deafness and physically handicapped.
And
as there are conflicts and debates over the country regarding the education system and its changes, this project helps in providing little step forward toward the change in the system to encourage learners, future generations. There are such situations where this project stands high
